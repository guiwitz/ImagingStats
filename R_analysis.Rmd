# Introduction

This notebook accompanies the [Imaging Statistics](https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto_ilias3_unibe_crs_2077609.html) course given at the University of Bern as part of the [Microscopy Imaging Center](https://www.mic.unibe.ch) trainings.

The goal of this practical session is to work with a benchmark dataset from single-cell fluorescence microscopy, to visualise the data, obtain basic statistics, and to fit a model to a dose response. The [dataset](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC013) comes from the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org).

> This 96-well plate has images of cytoplasm to nucleus translocation of the Forkhead (FKHR-EGFP) fusion protein in stably transfected human osteosarcoma cells, U2OS. In proliferating cells, FKHR is localized in the cytoplasm. Even without stimulation, Forkhead is constantly moving into the nucleus, but is transported out again by export proteins. Upon inhibition of nuclear export, FKHR accumulates in the nucleus. In this assay, export is inhibited by blocking PI3 kinase / PKB signaling by incubating cells for 1 h with Wortmannin or with the compound LY294002. Both drugs are considered positive controls in the assay. Nuclei are stained with DRAQ, a DNA stain.

# Data preparation

```{r}
# Add a grouping column
dat[,
    group := ifelse(well.row %in% LETTERS[1:4],
                    "GR1",
                    "GR2")]

# Set the order of factors
dat[,
    drug.type := factor(drug.type, 
                        levels = c("Empty",
                                   "Negative Control",
                                   "Wortmannin",

                                   "Positive Control"))]
```


# Data overview

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Define "dodging" to add space between violins-plots 
# and align them with box-plots
dodge <- position_dodge(width = 0.4)

p1 = ggplot2::ggplot(data = dat,
                     aes(x = as.factor(amount),
                         y = intensity)) +

                        outlier.shape = NA, 
                        position = dodge, 
                        width = 0.1) +

## Sample size

Measurement count per group.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
p2 = ggplot2::ggplot(data = dat,
                     aes(x = as.factor(amount))) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(aes(fill = drug.type), 
                    stat = "count",
                    position = "dodge") +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(name = "Drug type",
                               palette = "Tableau 10") +
  ggthemes::scale_color_tableau(name = "Drug type",
                                palette = "Tableau 10") +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~group, 
                      ncol = 1, 
                      scales = "free_x") +
  ggplot2::xlab("Concentration") +
  ggplot2::ylab("Count") +
  ggplot2::theme_bw()

```

## Area vs intensity

Is intensity correlated with the area? It should not and here we verify it visually!

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot2::ggplot(dat,
                aes(x = area,
                    y = intensity)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +
  ggplot2::theme_classic()
```

## Assay performance

From the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F108705719900400206):

Zhang, J, Chung, TDY, Oldenburg, KR: *A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.* J Biomol Screen **1999**;4:67-73.

> The Zâ€²-factor indicates how well separated the positive and negative controls are, given the variation present in both populations. It is a characteristic parameter for the quality of the assay itself, without intervention of test compunds.

$$ Z' = 1 - \frac{3\sigma_{C+} + 3\sigma_{C-}}{|\mu_{C+} - \mu_{C-}|}$$
Where, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the positive ($C+$) and negative ($C-$) controls.

![An example of plates with different Z'-factors. Credit: Anika John.](R_analysis-figure/plates-Zprime.png)

Let's quantify the separation between positive and negative controls in our screen using Z'-factor.

```{r}
# Calculate the mean and standard deviation for controls per group
datAggr = dat[drug.type %in% c("Negative Control",
                               "Positive Control"),
              .(grMn = mean(intensity),
                grSD = sd(intensity)),
              by = .(group, drug.type)]

# Convert to wide format such that we have all stats from both controls
# in the same row
datAggrWide = datAggr %>%
  dcast(group ~ drug.type, 
        value.var = c("grMn", "grSD"))

# Fix column names; remove spaces
setnames(datAggrWide, 
         make.names(names(datAggrWide)))

# Calculate Z'
datAggrWide[,
            Zprime := 1 - 
              (3*grSD_Positive.Control + 3*grSD_Negative.Control) / 
              abs(grMn_Positive.Control - grMn_Negative.Control)]

datAggrWide %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(digits = 2) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_paper(full_width = F, )
```

Thresholds for Z'-factor:

* $>0.5$ is considered an excellent assay,
* $>0$ is potentially screenable,
* $<=0$ distinguishing between positive and negative controls is difficult or impossible.

# Normalisation

Normalised Percentage Activation: $$NPA = \frac{meas - CTRL_-}{CTRL_+ - CTRL_-}$$

Where $CTRL_-$ and $CTRL_+$ are mean negative and positive controls, respectively, and $meas$ is the measurement in a single cell. 

```{r}
#  Add a column with the mean intensity of the negative control 
# for each group
dat[,
    mn.negctrl := mean(.SD[drug.type == "Negative Control",
                           intensity]),
    by = group]


# Add a column with the mean intensity of the positive control 
# for each group
dat[,
    mn.posctrl := mean(.SD[drug.type == "Positive Control", 
                           intensity]),
    by = group]

# Calculate NPA for EACH measurement
dat[,
    npa := (intensity - mn.negctrl) / (mn.posctrl - mn.negctrl)]

# Clean; remove temporary columns
dat[,
    c("mn.negctrl", "mn.posctrl") := NULL]
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = dat,
                aes(x = as.factor(amount),
                    y = npa)) +
  ggplot2::geom_violin(aes(fill = drug.type),

# Fit a sigmoid response

Calculate EC50, i.e. concentration that induces a response halfway between the baseline and the maximum.

[Dose-Response Analysis Using R](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146021), PLoS ONE 2015.

Using the [drc package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drc/).

[Dose Response Modelling in R](http://www.darrenkoppel.com/2020/09/04/dose-response-modelling-and-model-selection-in-r/) provides a good summary of the process. 

## 3-parameter Hill function

The three-parameter log-logistic dose response function with lower limit 0 is: $$f(x) = \frac{d}{1+\exp(b(\log(x)-\log(e)))}$$

Where:

- $b$ is the steepness of the curve (~ nthe Hill coefficient),
- $d$ is the maximum value,
- $e$ is the dose of the sigmoid midpoint,
- $x$ is the dose.

```{r}
# Parameters of the log-logistic dose response function
b = -2
d = 2
e = 2

# Define the log-logistic dose response function
mySigF = function(x, d, b, e) { 
  d / ( 1 + exp(b * ( log(x) - log(e) )) ) 
}

xarg = 10^seq(-3,3,0.1)

{
  plot(xarg, mySigF(xarg, d, b, e), type = "l", log = "x")
  abline(v = e, lty = 2)
}
```

## Fitting

We use the default non-robust least squares estimation ("mean") method to fit the dose response to the single-cell data.

```{r}
drfit = drc::drm(formula = npa ~ amount,
                 curveid = group,
                 data = dat[drug.type %in% c("Negative Control", 
                                             "LY294002", 
                                             "Wortmannin")],
                 fct = LL.3())

summary(drfit)
```

## Fitted model

```{r}
plot(drfit, 
     broken = T, 
     col = T,
     conName = "CTRL-",
     ylim = c(0,2), 
     xlab = "Concentration",
     ylab = "NPA")
```

## Fitted ED50

The estimation of the effective dose (EC50 / ED50 / IC50), i.e. the dose that induces the half-maximum response.

```{r}
drc::ED(drfit, respLev = 50, interval = "delta")
```

## Relative potency

Relative potency calculated as the ratio of ED50 estimates for both groups.

```{r}
drc::EDcomp(drfit, percVec = c(50, 50), interval = "delta")
```

## Slope comparison 

Comparison of slopes by means of a z-test for estimates from both groups.

```{r}
drc::compParm(drfit, strVal = "b", operator = "-")
```
