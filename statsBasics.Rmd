## Intro {.normal}

This lecture accompanies the [Imaging Statistics](https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto_ilias3_unibe_crs_2077609.html) course given at Bern University as part of the [Microscopy Imaging Center](https://www.mic.unibe.ch) trainings.

Based on the [Minitab Blog](https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-hypothesis-tests-why-we-need-to-use-hypothesis-tests-in-statistics) series.

## Why We Need Hypothesis Tests? {.bigger}

> A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a **population** to determine which statement is best supported by the **sample** data. 

> - What does statistical significance mean?
> - What is a p-value?
> - How to interpret confidence intervals?

## Population vs Sample {.bigger}

How well does a sample statistic estimate an underlying population parameter?

<div class="centered">
![](statsBasics-figure/conf_int_sample_pops.png){width=80%}
</div>

## Population

> - Let's measure the mean fluorescence intensity (FI) of cells subject to a treatment. 
> - The FI in single cells varies across the population and follows a distribution with $\mu = 5$ (mean).

<div class="centered">
```{r, fig.height=4}
nPopMn = 5.
nPopSD = 1.

{
  plot(function(x) dnorm(x, mean = nPopMn, sd = nPopSD), 0, 10,
       xlab = "Fluorescence intensity in single cells",
       ylab = "Density")
  abline(v = 5, lty = 2, col = ggthemes::hc_pal()(3)[1])
  abline(v = c(4, 6), lty = 2, col = ggthemes::hc_pal()(3)[2])
}
```
</div>

## What is a sample?

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:45%'>
> - We're interested in estimating the mean FI in the cell **population**. 
> - In experiments we cannot *access* the true population mean unless we measure everything. 
> - *Sampling* the reality is the next best thing we can do!


> - A sample consists of measurements of FI in individual cells.
> - A sample mean is the mean calculated from a sample.

## Sample vs population statistic

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:45%'>
> - Let's measure FI in 6 different fields of view (FOV), with 10 cells in each FOV. 
> - We calculate the mean FI for every FOV and obtain 6 sample means.
> - The mean FI from each FOV is usually far from the population mean (=5)!

## P values vs CI

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
> - You can use either P values or confidence intervals to determine whether your results are statistically significant.
> - If a hypothesis test produces both, these results will agree.
> - The confidence level is equivalent to $1 - \alpha$-level. 
</div>

<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>
> - If the P value is less than your significance level ($\alpha$), the hypothesis test is statistically significant.
> - If the confidence interval does not contain the null hypothesis value, the results are statistically significant.
> - If the P value is less than $\alpha$, the confidence interval will not contain the null hypothesis value.
</div>

## P values vs CI II

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
The **significance level** defines the distance the sample mean must be from the null hypothesis to be considered statistically significant.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
fPlotShadedTdist(nSz = nSz1, nMn = nPopMn, nSD = nPopSD,

                 main = "Sampling distribution, shaded 1%",
                 xlab = "Fluorescence intensity",
                 ylab = "Density")  
```

</div>

<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>
The **confidence level** defines the distance for how close the confidence limits are to sample mean.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
fPlotShadedTdist(nSz = nSz1, nMn = 4.2, nSD = 1, 
                 vertLines = c(4.2), 
                 vertLinesCol = c("#7cb5ec"),
                 nFrac = 0.95, xlim = c(2,8), inv = F,

<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>
