# Imaging statistics

This is the repository containing the material for the Imaging statistics course given at Bern University in the frame of the Microscopy Imaging Center trainings. Material has been created by Guillaume Witz (Bern University, MIC-ScITS) and Maciej Dobrzynski (Bern University, Cellular Dynamics Lab). 

The course illustrates an image processing pipeline from data download to statistical analysis realized in Python and R. Notebooks can be rn interactively either via the [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) service or via Google Colab using the badges at the top of this Readme.
